Q1.Automate Form Filling Using Selenium and Python. 

Steps:
Open firefox 
1.On right corner click on extensions
2.Search for selenium IDE 
3.Click on Add to Firefox
or
3.Open URLhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/selenium-ide/ It will redirect you to the official add-on page of Firefox. and click on add to firefox

4.Go to the top right corner on your Firefox browser and look for the Selenium IDE icon
5.Click on that icon to launch Selenium IDE.
6.Click on : Create a new project, give name and click ok
7.Rename the project as "selenium_demo".
8.Rename the test case as "javaTpoint_test"
9.Click on the "Start Recording" Button present on the top right corner 
10.Set your project's base URL as www.google.com
11.It will redirect you to the Google search engine page.
Perform some actions on browser https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp
It will redirect you to the Google search engine page.

13.The Log pane displays the overall summary of the executed test scripts.
14.Click on the save button present on the extreme right corner of the menu bar. Save the entire test suite as "name.side‚Äù Test.

15. Make new folder and a file inside it with name 
formautomate.py
sudo nano formautomate.py
# form_fill.py
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
import time
# Initialize Chrome driver
driver = webdriver.Chrome()
# Step 1: Open form page
driver.get("https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp")
driver.maximize_window()
# Step 2: Find input fields by name
fname = driver.find_element(By.ID, "fname")
Subject Incharge : Sujata Oak Department of Information Technology
lname = driver.find_element(By.ID, "lname")
# Step 3: Clear and fill the form fields
fname.clear()
fname.send_keys("Sujata")
lname.clear()
lname.send_keys("Oak")
# Step 4: Scroll and click Submit button
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "//input[@type='submit']").click()
# Step 5: Wait and print the new URL
time.sleep(5)
print("Form submitted successfully!")
print("Redirected URL:", driver.current_url)
# Step 6: Close browser
driver.quit()

16.If python not installed
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 -y

17.Run python file
python3 filename.py



or   



1.Automate Form Filling Using Selenium (on Ubuntu)
Goal: Run a Python script that opens Chrome, fills a web form, and submits it.

Step 1: Install All Requirements (Terminal)
Run these 4 commands one by one. This is the most important step to prevent errors.

Update Ubuntu's package list:

Bash
sudo apt update
Install pip (the Python installer):

Bash
sudo apt install python3-pip
Install the chromedriver (the "remote control" for Chrome):

Bash
sudo apt install chromium-chromedriver
Install selenium (the Python library):

Bash
pip3 install selenium
(If you run these, you will not get the ModuleNotFoundError)

Open VScode

from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
import time

# Initialize Chrome driver
driver = webdriver.Chrome()

# Step 1: Open form page
driver.get("https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp")
driver.maximize_window()

# Step 2: Find input fields by ID
fname = driver.find_element(By.ID, "fname")
lname = driver.find_element(By.ID, "lname")

# Step 3: Clear and fill the form fields
fname.clear()
fname.send_keys("Alok")  # Use your name

lname.clear()
lname.send_keys("Sahoo") # Use your last name

# Step 4: Find and click Submit button
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "//input[@type='submit']").click()

# Step 5: Wait and print the new URL
time.sleep(5)
print("Form submitted successfully!")
print("Redirected URL:", driver.current_url)

# Step 6: Close browser
driver.quit()

Step 3: Run Your Script (Terminal)
Make sure you are in the same folder as your selenium_form.py file.

Bash
python3 selenium_form.py
